## 📊 **WHAT WE REMOVED**

### **❌ Scripts NOT Included (Internal Development Only)**
These scripts were removed as they're not valuable for public users:

- `checkpoint-logger.sh` - Internal development tracking
- `milestone-tracker.sh` - Internal progress tracking  
- `enterprise-test-robust.sh` - Duplicate testing functionality
- `enterprise-test-suite-5apps.sh` - Duplicate testing functionality
- `enterprise-test-suite.sh` - Duplicate testing functionality
- `cleanup-local-databases.sh` - macOS-specific local development
- `verify-cleanup.sh` - Database-specific verification
- `test-runner.sh` - Replaced by comprehensive-test.sh

### **✅ Why We Kept These Scripts**
- **User Value**: Each script solves a real problem for DevOps practitioners
- **Enterprise Ready**: Scripts follow production best practices
- **Well Documented**: Clear usage instructions and safety features
