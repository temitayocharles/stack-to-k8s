---- `scripts/validate-lab.sh` runs smoke tests tailored to each lab’s acceptance criteria.

- `scripts/validate-links.sh` verifies Markdown links using `markdown-link-check` with sensible retry and ignore defaults.

## 🧰 Learning toolkit- `.github/markdown-link-check.json` centralises link-check behaviour so CI and local runs stay consistent.
