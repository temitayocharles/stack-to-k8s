   - **Dependencies**: Educational platform completion
   - **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours total

### CHECKPOINT MARKERS

- ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT_1**: Security Testing Framework - ecommerce-app fully validated with enterprise testing suite
- ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT_2**: Advanced K8s Features - All applications have flat structure with HPA, Network Policies, PDB, Resource Quotas, RBAC
- ‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT_3**: Cleanup & Sanity Checks - Comprehensive cleanup procedures implemented workspace-wide
- üîÑ **CHECKPOINT_4**: Progress Logging System - Currently implementing session tracking and context preservation
- ‚è≥ **CHECKPOINT_5**: Educational Platform Testing - Pending (Java Spring Boot + Angular comprehensive testing)
- ‚è≥ **CHECKPOINT_6**: Multi-Application Testing - Pending (remaining 3 applications)

### DECISION POINTS & CONTEXT

#### Key Decisions Made:
- **Flat Structure**: User preferred flat manifests over nested folders for K8s advanced features
- **Humanized Commits**: User requested simple, emoji-free commit messages
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: User emphasized importance of sanity checks and workspace hygiene
- **Progress Logging**: User wants seamless work resumption with checkpoints

#### User Preferences Noted:
- Simple, uncluttered documentation structure
- Visual aids and step-by-step instructions
- Container-first development approach
- Zero tolerance for failures policy
- Immediate cleanup after testing

#### Technical Debt Identified:
- **Low Priority**: Consider automating advanced features deployment script
- **Medium Priority**: Add monitoring setup to remaining applications
- **High Priority**: Complete testing suite for educational platform

#### Context for AI Assistant:
- User works intermittently and needs context preservation
- Focus on real working applications, not toy examples
- Emphasize production-ready deployments
- Maintain workspace cleanliness and organization
