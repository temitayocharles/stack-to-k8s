## 🚧 **TROUBLESHOOTING YOUR OPERATIONS JOURNEY**
### **"When Team Coordination Systems Don't Go According to Plan"**

### **❌ "Real-Time Updates Not Working"**

**If you see: "WebSocket connection failed"**
1. **Check WebSocket service**: `kubectl get pods -l app=websocket-server`
2. **Verify Redis is running**: `kubectl logs deployment/redis -n task-management`
3. **Test WebSocket endpoint**: Use browser dev tools to check WS connections

**If you see: "Updates delayed or missing"**
1. **Check Redis pub/sub**: `kubectl exec redis-pod -- redis-cli monitor`
2. **Verify event broadcasting**: `kubectl logs deployment/task-api -f`
3. **Restart WebSocket service**: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/websocket-server`

### **❌ "Team Collaboration Issues"**

**If you see: "Users can't see each other's changes"**
1. **Check user sessions**: Visit admin panel → Active Sessions
2. **Verify presence system**: `kubectl logs deployment/presence-service`
3. **Test with incognito browsers**: Ensure different user sessions

**If you see: "Conflict resolution not working"**
1. **Check merge algorithms**: `kubectl logs deployment/conflict-resolver`
2. **Review operational transform**: Check collaborative editing logs
3. **Verify database transactions**: Monitor PostgreSQL slow query log

### **❌ "Performance Issues with Large Teams"**

**If dashboard loads slowly with many users:**
1. **Scale WebSocket service**: `kubectl scale deployment websocket-server --replicas=5`
2. **Check Redis memory usage**: Monitor Redis dashboard in Grafana
3. **Optimize database queries**: Review PostgreSQL performance insights

**If real-time updates lag:**
1. **Monitor message queues**: Check NATS streaming dashboard
2. **Scale Redis cluster**: Add more Redis instances for pub/sub
3. **Optimize event payloads**: Reduce WebSocket message sizes
