## 🚀 **Option 1: Super Quick Start (5 minutes)**

### **Use Pre-Built Images**
```bash
# Navigate to task management app:
cd task-management-app

# Start everything instantly:
docker-compose up -d

# Check it's running:
docker-compose ps
```

**Then open:** http://localhost:3002

---

## 🛠️ **Option 2: Build Experience (15 minutes)**

### **Build from Source**
```bash
# Navigate to the app:
cd task-management-app

# Build Go microservices (watch the compilation):
docker-compose build

# Start the platform:
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor the startup logs:
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

**Watch the Go build process and see how microservices start!**

## 🎯 **Test the Advanced Features**

### **1. Check System Health**
```bash
# Test comprehensive health checks:
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/health | jq .

# Expected: 5/6 systems healthy with detailed metrics
```

### **2. Try AI Task Prioritization**
```bash
# Test AI-powered prioritization:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/v1/ai/prioritize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tasks": [
      {"id": "task-1", "title": "Critical Bug Fix", "priority": "high"},
      {"id": "task-2", "title": "Documentation", "priority": "medium"}
    ],
    "user_id": "user-1",
    "context": {
      "user_context": {"current_workload": 0.7, "energy_level": 0.8},
      "temporal_context": {"time_of_day": "morning"}
    }
  }' | jq .

# Expected: Smart prioritization with confidence scores and reasoning
```

### **3. Test Time Tracking**
```bash
# Start time tracking:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/v1/time/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user-1",
    "task_id": "task-1",
    "activity_type": "development"
  }' | jq .

# Expected: Active time tracking session created
```

### **4. View Analytics Dashboard**
```bash
# Get user productivity dashboard:
curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/analytics/dashboard/user-1 | jq .

# Expected: Comprehensive analytics with productivity metrics
```

## 🧠 **Understanding What You're Seeing**

### **Go Microservices Architecture**
```
Frontend (Svelte) ←→ API Gateway (Go)
                          ↓
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │   Advanced Go Microservices         │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ • AI Intelligence Engine           │
    │ • Prioritization Engine            │
    │ • Time Tracking Engine             │
    │ • Analytics Engine                 │
    │ • Collaboration Engine             │
    │ • Health Monitoring System         │

                          ↓
              PostgreSQL + CouchDB
```

### **Advanced Features in Action**
- **AI Prioritization**: Machine learning algorithms rank tasks
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket connections for instant updates
- **Microservices**: Independent Go services for scalability
- **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time project health monitoring

## 📊 **Monitor System Performance**

### **Check Container Resources**
```bash
# See Go microservices performance:
docker stats

# Check individual service logs:
docker-compose logs backend | grep "initialized"

# Expected output:
# 🧠 AI Intelligence Engine initialized
# 🎯 Enhanced AI Prioritization Engine initialized
# ⏱️ Time Tracking Engine initialized
# 📊 Project Analytics Engine initialized
```

### **Database Performance**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL connection:
docker-compose exec db psql -U taskuser -d taskmanagement -c "SELECT version();"

# Expected: PostgreSQL version info
```

---

## 🔧 **Common Quick Fixes**

### **If containers won't start:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### **If Go build fails:**
```bash
# Clean Go modules:
docker-compose exec backend go mod tidy
docker-compose restart backend
```

### **If frontend won't load:**
```bash
# Check Svelte compilation:
docker-compose logs frontend

# Restart frontend:
docker-compose restart frontend
```
