## üéì Next Steps After Completion

1. **Practice**: Redeploy the apps from memory without looking at labs
2. **Experiment**: Modify manifests and see what breaks (intentionally!)
3. **Build**: Deploy your own application using these patterns
4. **Certify**: Consider CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) exam
5. **Share**: Help others learn Kubernetes using this workspace

## üí° Study Tips

- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand each concept
- **Type everything**: Don't copy-paste, type kubectl commands
- **Break things**: Learn by fixing what you break
- **Ask why**: Understand WHY each resource is needed
- **Review manifests**: Study the YAML files in each app's k8s/ folder

**Remember**: Mastery comes from repetition. Redo labs that challenge you!
