## **🚨 Most Common Issues**

### **Problem 1: "Nothing Happens When I Run Commands"**

**You will see:** Terminal just sits there, no output

**First, try this:**
```bash
docker --version
```

**If you see a version number:** Docker is working, continue below  
**If you see "command not found":** You need to install Docker first

**👆 Fix this:** [Install Docker Guide](./install-docker.md)

---

### **Problem 2: "Port Already in Use" Error**

**You will see:** Something like "port 3001 is already in use"

**First, find what's using the port:**
```bash
lsof -i :3001
```

**You will see:** A list of programs using that port

**Kill the process:**
```bash
kill -9 [PID_NUMBER]
```
*(Replace PID_NUMBER with the actual number you see)*

**Then try again:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Problem 3: "Website Not Loading"**

**You will see:** Browser shows "This site can't be reached"

**Wait 2 minutes first** - containers need time to start

**Then check if everything is running:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**You should see:** All services showing "Up" status

**If any show "Exit" or "Restarting":**
```bash
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

**Check the logs for errors** → [Log Reading Guide](./reading-logs.md)

---

### **Problem 4: "Database Connection Error"**

**You will see:** Error messages about MongoDB or connection refused

**Restart the database:**
```bash
docker-compose restart mongodb
```

**Wait 30 seconds, then test:**
```bash
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
```

**You should see:** `{ ok: 1 }`

### **Problem 5: "Everything is Slow"**

**You will see:** Pages take forever to load

**Check your computer's resources:**
```bash
docker stats
```

**You will see:** How much CPU and memory each container uses

**If usage is high (>80%):**
1. Close other programs
2. Restart Docker Desktop
3. Try again

**Still slow?** → [Performance Optimization](./performance-fixes.md)

## **🔄 Nuclear Option - Start Fresh**

**When nothing else works, reset everything:**

### **Step 1: Stop Everything**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### **Step 2: Clean Up**
```bash
docker system prune -f
```

### **Step 3: Start Fresh**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**This will:** Delete everything and start over with a clean slate

## **🆘 Still Having Problems?**

### **Check These Common Causes:**

1. **Not enough disk space** - Docker needs at least 10GB free
2. **VPN interfering** - Try disconnecting your VPN
3. **Antivirus blocking** - Add Docker to your antivirus exceptions
4. **Windows/Mac specific issues** - Check our OS-specific guides

## **✅ Prevention Tips**

**To avoid problems next time:**

1. **Always check Docker is running** before starting
2. **Close other programs** that might use ports 3000-5001
3. **Wait patiently** - containers take time to start
4. **Read error messages** - they usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Keep backups** of working configurations
