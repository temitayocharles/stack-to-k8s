## **Phase 1: Understanding the Pieces (20 minutes)**

### **Step 1.1: Look at What We're Building**

**Open this file in your code editor:**
```bash
code docker-compose.yml
```

**You will see:** A file that describes 4 services:
- **Frontend**: The website customers see
- **Backend**: The server that handles requests  
- **MongoDB**: Where we store product and order data
- **Redis**: Fast memory storage for sessions

**Why these 4?** This is how real e-commerce sites work - they separate concerns for scalability

**Next:** Let's understand what each service does → **[Continue to Step 1.2](./step-1-2-service-overview.md)**

## **Phase 2: Building the Foundation (30 minutes)**

**You'll do these steps one by one:**

### **Step 2.1: Start the Database First**
- Why we start with data storage
- How to verify it's working
- What to do if it fails

### **Step 2.2: Add the Cache Layer**  
- Why Redis makes things faster
- How to test the connection
- Common Redis issues and fixes

### **Step 2.3: Start the Backend API**
- How the server connects to database
- Testing the API endpoints
- Reading server logs for troubleshooting

### **Step 2.4: Launch the Frontend**
- How the website talks to the backend
- Verifying the user interface
- Checking browser developer tools
