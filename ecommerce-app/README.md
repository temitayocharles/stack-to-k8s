- "Port 5000 already in use" → Change PORT in .env file

**Next, you do this:**
1. Open a new terminal tab
2. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`

**You will see this:**
```
$ cd frontend && npm install
added 1200 packages from 500 contributors
```

**Next, you do this:**
1. Start the frontend: `npm start`

**You will see this:**
```
$ npm start
Compiled successfully!
Local: http://localhost:3000
```
