## Deployment

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

#### Using GitHub Actions
1. Push to `main` branch for production deployment
2. Push to `develop` branch for staging deployment
3. Monitor deployment status in GitHub Actions tab

#### Using Jenkins
1. Configure Jenkins pipeline with provided `Jenkinsfile`
2. Set up required credentials and environment variables
3. Trigger builds manually or via webhooks

#### Using GitLab CI
1. Push code to GitLab repository
2. Configure CI/CD variables in GitLab settings
3. Pipelines run automatically on push

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build images
docker build -t weather-app-backend ./backend
docker build -t weather-app-frontend ./frontend

# Run containers
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 weather-app-backend
docker run -d -p 8080:80 weather-app-frontend
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Apply base manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/base/

# For production with advanced features
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/

# Apply monitoring stack
kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/
```

#### AWS EKS Deployment
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
cd terraform
terraform init

# Plan deployment
terraform plan -var-file="config/production.tfvars"

# Apply deployment
terraform apply -var-file="config/production.tfvars"
```
