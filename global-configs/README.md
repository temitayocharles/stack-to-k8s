# Global Configs

This folder contains the docker-compose.yml file for running all 6 applications together.

## Usage

This is used in **[Lab 7: Multi-App Orchestration](../labs/07-multi-app.md)**.

```bash
cd global-configs
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts all applications simultaneously for practicing multi-app Kubernetes deployments.
