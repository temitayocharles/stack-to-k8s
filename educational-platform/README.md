## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Docker Issues**
```bash
# Container not starting
docker logs container-name

# Port conflicts
docker ps -a
netstat -tulpn | grep :8080

# Image build failures
docker build --no-cache -t image-name .
```

#### **Kubernetes Issues**
```bash
# Pod not starting
kubectl describe pod pod-name -n educational-platform
kubectl logs pod-name -n educational-platform

# Service not accessible
kubectl get endpoints -n educational-platform
kubectl port-forward service/service-name 8080:80

# Resource issues
kubectl get events -n educational-platform --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
kubectl top pods -n educational-platform
```

#### **Database Connectivity**
```bash
# PostgreSQL connection test
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U edu_user

# Redis connection test
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 -a redis_password ping
```

#### **Application Issues**
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Frontend build issues
cd frontend && npm run build

# API connectivity
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"
```

### Performance Tuning

#### **Database Optimization**
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Index analysis
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

#### **Application Tuning**
```bash
# JVM tuning for Spring Boot
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1g -XX:+UseG1GC"

# Node.js memory tuning
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1024"
```

### Monitoring & Debugging

#### **Application Monitoring**
```bash
# Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus

# Custom metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used
```

#### **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Search logs for errors
kubectl logs -f deployment/backend -n educational-platform | grep ERROR

# Structured log analysis
kubectl logs deployment/backend -n educational-platform --since=1h | \
  jq 'select(.level == "ERROR")'
```
