## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
```yaml
Process:

  2. Run health checks and smoke tests
  3. Switch traffic from "Blue" to "Green"
  4. Monitor for issues
  5. Keep "Blue" as immediate rollback option
```

### Canary Deployment
```yaml
Process:
  1. Deploy to small subset of users (5%)
  2. Monitor metrics and error rates
  3. Gradually increase traffic (25%, 50%, 75%)
  4. Full rollout or rollback based on metrics
  5. Automated rollback on error thresholds
```

### Rolling Deployment
```yaml
Process:
  1. Update pods one at a time
  2. Wait for health checks
  3. Continue to next pod
  4. Maintain service availability
  5. Gradual complete replacement
```

Scenarios:
  - Normal load testing
  - Stress testing
  - Spike testing
  - Volume testing
  - Endurance testing

Metrics Collected:
  - Response times (p95, p99)
  - Throughput (requests/second)
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization
  - Database performance
```

## 🔄 Rollback Strategies

  - Memory/CPU resource exhaustion

Manual Rollback:
  - One-click rollback capability
  - Database migration rollback
  - Configuration rollback
  - Traffic switching
```

This CI/CD pipeline provides:
