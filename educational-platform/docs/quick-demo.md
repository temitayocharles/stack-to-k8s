# Build Angular frontend (watch npm build):
docker-compose build frontend

# Start the platform:
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor the startup logs:
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

**Watch the Java compilation and Angular build process!**

    "enrollmentDate": "2024-01-15"
  }' | jq .

# Expected: Enrollment confirmation with progress tracking
```

### **4. Test Quiz System**
```bash
# Get available quizzes:
curl http://localhost:8080/api/quizzes/course/1 | jq .

# Submit quiz answer:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/quiz-submissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "studentId": "student-123",
    "quizId": 1,
    "answers": [
      {"questionId": 1, "selectedOption": "A"},
      {"questionId": 2, "selectedOption": "C"}
    ]

## 📊 **Monitor System Performance**

### **Check Java Application**
```bash
# See Spring Boot performance:
docker stats educational-platform-backend

# Check application metrics:
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics | jq .

# Expected output shows JVM metrics, database connections, HTTP requests
```

### **Database Performance**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL connection:
docker-compose exec db psql -U eduuser -d education -c "SELECT version();"

# View course data:
docker-compose exec db psql -U eduuser -d education -c "SELECT title, instructor FROM courses LIMIT 5;"
```

### **Frontend Performance**
```bash
# Check Angular application logs:
docker-compose logs frontend

# Expected: Angular compilation success and server startup
```

---

## 🔧 **Common Quick Fixes**

### **If backend won't start:**
```bash
# Clean Maven cache and rebuild:
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
docker-compose up -d
```

### **If database connection fails:**
```bash
# Check database logs:
docker-compose logs db

# Restart database:
docker-compose restart db
```

### **If frontend won't load:**
```bash
# Check Angular compilation:
docker-compose logs frontend

# Rebuild frontend:
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose restart frontend
```
