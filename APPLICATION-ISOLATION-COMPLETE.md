## 🔍 **ISOLATION AUDIT RESULTS**

### **❌ VIOLATIONS FOUND & FIXED**

#### **1. Global Docker Compose Dependency - RESOLVED ✅**
**Problem Found**: 
- Root `docker-compose.yml` contained all applications in shared network
- Created artificial dependencies between independent applications
- Violated the principle of application isolation

**Solution Implemented**:
- Moved global docker-compose.yml to `global-configs/docker-compose-REFERENCE-ONLY.yml`
- Each application already had its own standalone docker-compose.yml
- No shared networks or dependencies between applications

#### **2. External Documentation References - RESOLVED ✅**
**Problem Found**:
- All application README files referenced `../ABOUT-THE-CREATOR.md`
- Created dependency on external files outside application folders
- Violated self-contained principle

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced all external references with inline creator information
- Each application now has complete standalone documentation
- No dependencies on files outside the application folder

#### **3. Missing Application-Specific Scripts - RESOLVED ✅**
**Problem Found**:
- Applications relied on global scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- No application-specific cleanup or management tools
- Created dependency on external workspace structure

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `cleanup.sh` script to each application folder
- Each script is application-specific and self-contained
- No dependencies on global scripts
